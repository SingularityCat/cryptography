AES is a subset of the Rijndael family of ciphers standardized by NIST,
 the US "National Institute of Standards and Technology".

The Rijndael family of ciphers supported many different block/key sizes, specifically
 any block and any key length between 128 and 256 bits that is a multiple of 32 bits.

AES reduces this set to a fixed 128-bit block size, with either 128, 192 or 256 bit keys.
